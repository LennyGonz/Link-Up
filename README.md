**New York City is without a question the greatest city in the world**

There have been so many iconic shows that used New York City as their setting such as:
- *How I Met Your Mother*,
- *Mr. Robot*, 
- *Seinfield*

to name a few.

These shows are what millions of people outside New York are exposed to. Their impression of this city is based on what they see in these shows.

So what I am aiming to do here, is guide people to all of the iconic attractions in our city, while also giving them an authentic tour of the city.
  * For example, if you want some great mexican food you're not gonna find it in midtown. 

This web app is meant to change a tourists perspective of New York City. NYC is much more than just Times Square, or the Statue of Liberty.
This city is home to so many cultures and has an abundance of history to just visit Times Square. If you're going to do NYC, let me help you do it right!
